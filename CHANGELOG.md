**New Features:**  
• Added more sail names and mast names;  
• Topmast sail are now renamed correctly;  
• Added anchor info to the anchor winch;  
• Coordinates now can be shown using the decimal system (the same as the online map);  
• Really big performance improvement;  
• Reworked the Configuration file, for improved readability and usability with the Configuration Manager;
• Added Tiller compatibility for Paraw and Dinghies mods; 
  
**Bugfixes:**

**CREDITS:**  
 → Massive code refactor and improvements by NAND, which made most of the work for this update!  

**NOTES:**
→ I'd recommend deleting the old configuration file before updating the mod so that it can be regenerated correctly.
→ With such a huge code refactor, two people having worked on it and so many options, it's possible to have some little mistakes here and there. If something does not work as before, or seems bugged let me know!
